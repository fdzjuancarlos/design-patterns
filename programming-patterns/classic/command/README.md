#  Command Pattern

Command patterns allows us to encapsulate logic in a single object.

We can store every produced command and we could implement default behaviour for commands like undo or redo actions.

We could also implement default behaviour for every executed command like logging the actions.

# Problem

We need to make a calculator. This calculator takes the user input in order to make the operations.

Every input can be undone or re-done it. Every user action must be logged.
